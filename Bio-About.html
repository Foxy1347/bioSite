            <!-- Set margins-->
            <p style="text-indent: 40px">TeaLi Morillo-Fox is not the typical type of teenager you would see in a Midwestern town. Having spent most of their younger years in central Texas, TeaLi has spent a good amount of time camping, hiking, geocaching, and otherwise enjoying the nature. Because of their time outside TeaLi has learned about animals, their habitat, and how humans affect them. TeaLi is interested in not only how animals lived but how they are after they die. TeaLi has been taking an interest in animal preservation and has been looking into the legal requirements for obtaining animal material that would become a road hazard or otherwise disposed of by the city.</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px">As far as their long term goals, TeaLi would like to move back to Texas. After de-tasseling, they have shown an interest in seasonal work. Especially work that would allow them to travel. TeaLi is currently interested in being able to see more of the country and looking at possibly traveling even further.</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px">When TeaLi isn't busy with school work or hanging out with friends, they can be found filling pages with drawings and exploring new concepts and techniques. TeaLi has also been looking into different avenues of art. Recently they have been looking at jewelry making, digital art, and possibly stained glass.</p>
